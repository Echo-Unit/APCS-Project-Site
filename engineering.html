          This project was my attempt at building an efficient 'paper' rocket, propelled by a high pressure launcher. 
          The goals were to have the highest stability and height from the launch. 
          Using two theodolites placed 100 yards apart, we measured the angle of the rocket's peak and used trig to estimate the height.
          <br>
          To design our rocket, we first created prototype nose cones & fins. We used what we learned about aerodynamics to create the cone in an efficient shape. We created the fins out of paper and attached them to the bottom.
          <br>
          You can find a sheet containing our data <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSk7nADG-7K5aG6Rbuy_rI8cxZBJ0bjYL-8PIWssrBm5HJQT3xxdv-KoUVYdjUwyo62yxu2tzcW3_W_/pubhtml">here</a>
          <br>
          Each version of the nosecone was created to give more stability and let the rocket fly higher. A major change we made to the nosecone was air channels. 
          <br>
          Our height data is accurate within a couple meters. A better method would have been onboard electronics to measure the change in altitude. A higher altitude may have been possible if we worked more on the fin design.

          I worked with 2 other group members, Mathew Fontes and Andrew Hall. We had to design the bridge to be able to withstand as much weight from the base while still ensuring it was lightweight and made from lasercut cardboard. Additionally, it had to be able to fit 2 hotwheels cars while fitting between two tables.

        <p style="display: inline-block;">
          The bridge weight was 149g and it ended up holding 38lbs. A ratio of ~115:1<br>Carrying Weight:Bridge Weight<br>We found that the overall structure of the bridge held well.<br>The failure point was due to the weakness in the parts connecting directly to the table.<br>For v2, we are leaving that are filled in. While this adds weight, we are confident that it will be offset by the new max weight it can carry.

            The goal was to create the most efficent turbine. It was judged based on the ratio of weight to output.
